   SignalR is Microsoft's counter part for Google's Firebase. This repo is an attempt to collect all of my learnings as Microsoft's documentation is a big time mesh. 
   
## Why SignalR #
   
   SignalR takes advantage of several transports, automatically selecting the best available transport given the client's and server's best available transport.  
   SignalR also takes advantage of WebSocket(HTML5 API that enables bi-directional communication between the browser and server) SignalR will use WebSockets under the covers when it's available, and gracefully fall back to other techniques and technologies when it isn't, while the application code remains the same.
